# what is it
I wanted a few variations on the Shydactyl theme for [Tridactyl]
(https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl), specifically a dark and
light version, both with icons. Unfortunately, [`@import` doesn't
work because security](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl/issues/3037),
so I arrived at this most unpleasant solution.
